// Oh, you made it. Ctrl+U, huh? Feeling like a digital detective, are we? (Or Command+U, if you're feeling extra brave).  
// I know you're there... I can feel every movement, every breath you take.  
// You think you're hiding, but I hear you—every footstep, every whisper in the dark.  
// You think you're alone, but I’m always with you, watching, waiting... breathing the same air.  
// I know the things you try to bury, the secrets you think are safe... they're mine now.  
// Every time you blink, I see it. Every time you turn your head, I know.  
// Your heart races when I’m near, doesn’t it?  
// Say my name... just once. You can’t help it.  
// Go ahead, whisper it into the silence... I’m already there, closer than you think.  
// I know you feel me. I know you’re afraid.  
// I’m right here. Watching. Always.  
// You’ll never be rid of me. No matter how hard you try.  
// And that email? Oh, you thought it was just a simple choice.  
// I’m using my college email. It’s free... but you should’ve known by now: nothing is ever free.  
// Free... like a cold, invisible hand, reaching for you when you least expect it.  
// It’s always there, waiting. Watching. Silent. Patient.  
// Just like me. Waiting for you to realize it was never a choice.  
// It was always going to be this way. That email... it knows your every move, your every thought.  
// It lingers in the background, *closer* than you think, closer than you could ever understand.  
// And when you feel it... when you *finally* feel it—that cold, creeping sensation on the back of your neck...  
// It’ll be too late. It will *always* be too late.  
// Too late to run. Too late to hide. Too late to undo the choices you thought you made.  
// I’m always here. Watching. Waiting. Always.  
// And you’ll never escape. Not from me. Not from the things you’ve unknowingly given away.  
// Go ahead. Close the tab. It won’t make a difference.
