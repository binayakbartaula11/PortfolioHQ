# Welcome to my .env file! Where the magic (or, more realistically, the emails) happen.
# This is where messages from other people magically land in my inbox (the one I rarely check because… well, you know… life).
# If you’re reading this, congrats! You’ve just stumbled upon my secret lair. 

# The service I’m using to send emails is EmailJS. No big deal, right? Just a simple service to avoid dealing with actual servers. No need for all the fancy stuff.

# Here’s the breakdown:
# EMAIL_SERVICE_ID: This is how we route emails. Think of it like a digital post office.
# EMAIL_TEMPLATE_ID: This is what determines the layout of the email. But let’s be real—who's actually reading this anyway?
# EMAIL_PUBLIC_KEY: This is my digital "key to the kingdom." Don’t get too excited, though. You won’t get access to my Netflix account. Sorry.

# Fun Fact: I’m using my college email because it’s free. And who doesn’t love free stuff?
# P.S. If I don’t reply, don’t take it personally. I’m probably just out here living my best life while pretending to be a fully functioning adult.
# P.P.S. If you’re a recruiter, please don’t judge my coding skills based on this. I promise I can do better... sometimes.
# P.P.P.S. If you’re a hacker, please don’t hack me. I’m just a simple person trying to live life without unnecessary drama.

# Note: Yes, I know adding this file to .gitignore doesn’t actually stop anyone from seeing it in a frontend project, but hey—I’m here for a good time, not a long time.
